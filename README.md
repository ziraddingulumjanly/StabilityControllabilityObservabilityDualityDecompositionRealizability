# State-Space Models
This repository examines stability, observability, controllability, and model reduction in control engineering. Stability is analyzed using eigenvalues, observability is assessed through observability matrices and subspace decomposition, and controllability is verified using rank conditions and simulations. Model reduction is performed using Hankel singular values to retain dominant system dynamics while simplifying complexity. Simulation results validate theoretical findings by illustrating system responses under various conditions.
